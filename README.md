sick flow, bro
==============

The sickest of flows. Inspired by Java 8 [Streams](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/ma14-java-se-8-streams-2177646.html), flow is a C++14 library
that provides lazy evaluation and functional transformations on data. It's like Haskell for C++. The library provides many common data transformations, such as map, filter and fold, as well as other commonly used operations like computing the sum, min and max or simply counting the number or elements. And all of it is packaged in a nice, easy to read and understand syntax:
pipelining.
