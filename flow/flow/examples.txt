/// \example concat.cpp
/// <para>A simple flow::concat example. This operation appends a stream onto the end of another stream.
/// The type of elements in the <em>tail</em> stream must be convertible to the type of element in
/// the <em>head</em> stream.</para>
/// <para>Overloads are available which are shorthands for calling from().</para>

/// \example drop_while.cpp
/// <para>A simple flow::drop_while example. This operation removes elements from the front of the stream as long
/// as the elements return <c>true</c> for a given predicate. Once an element returns <c>false</c>, all elements
/// after and including that element are kept, even if later elements would be dropped by the predicate.</para>
/// <seealso cref="filter()"/>
/// <seealso cref="take_while()"/>

/// \example sort.cpp
/// <para>A flow::sort example. This is an eager operation that sorts the stream. During the sort, the entire
/// stream is evaluated, copied and stored in a new vector, which is sorted afterwards. This means the sorting operation
/// takes an additional <c>O(n)</c> space and time, excluding the actual sort. Because of this, sorting simple
/// streams should be avoided in favor of sorting the original source of the stream in place. The first example here is
/// one such case that should be avoided; it is included to show the output of the stream after the sort operation
/// takes place.</para>
/// <para>The second example is not as trivial, so sort should be used in that case. Other examples
/// may include times when the stream is filtered or mapped, or otherwise transformed.</para>
/// <seealso cref="stable_sort()"/>

/// \example zip.cpp
/// <para>A flow::zip example. The zip operation combines two streams into a single stream using a
/// zipping operation. A zipping operation takes the front element from each stream to produce an output.
/// By default, the zipping operation creates a <c>std::tuple</c> out of
/// the two elements. Multiple zipped streams concatenates tuples together so,</para>
/// \code{.cpp}vec | zip(vec) | zip(vec)\endcode
/// <para>will create a <c>std::tuple<T, T, T></c> rather than nesting tuples.</para>
/// <para>Other zipping operations are possible other than tuplfying the elements. A simple
/// example would be to compute the pairwise sum of elements from each stream.</para>
/// <para>Note that the flow namespace defines <c>operator<<</c> for tuples. It prints
/// each tuple element using <c>operator<</c>, with a familiar format. Note that the function
/// is also defined inside of the <c>std</c> namespace. This allows dump() to see the operator
/// and actually compile. To exclude the <c>std</c> version, <c>\#define FLOW_PRINTTUPLE_NO_STD</c>.</para>

/// \example terminal.cpp
/// <para>This example shows the extra functions available to terminal operations. These functions,
/// <c>then(), value(), value_or()</c> return a new terminal operation, so they can be combined and
/// chained together like other any terminal. The functions <c>value()</c> and <c>value_or()</c>
/// should only be used when the terminal returns an \ref optional object.</para>
